            <h2>Burst of solar activity expected to cause widespread appearance of aurora borealis.</h2>

            <p> Skywatchers have been alerted to look out for the Northern Lights, which could be visible tonight from Scotland and even as far south as Northern Ireland.</p>
            <br>
            <p>A surge in solar activity is expected to cause the awe-inspiring phenomenon to appear in northern parts of Britain.

                BBC weather presenter Angie Phillips said the best times would be from Saturday afternoon through to Sunday morning.</p>
            <br>
            <p>“Clear, dark skies are most favourable, with little or no light pollution, so getting out of the towns and into the countryside is best for viewing – weather permitting, of course,” she said.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The Northern Lights – also known as the aurora borealis – is caused by streams of charged particles escaping the sun (often known as solar winds) interacting with the Earth’s magnetic field.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Distortions in the magnetic field allow some charged particles to slip into the atmosphere around the north and south poles.

                As they hit gases in the atmosphere the particles make them glow, causing the mesmerising colourful displays in the sky.</p>

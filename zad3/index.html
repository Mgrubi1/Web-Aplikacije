            <p>An aurora (plural: auroras or aurorae), also known as the polar lights or aurora polaris, is a natural light display in Earth's sky,
                 predominantly seen in high-latitude regions (around the Arctic and Antarctic). Auroras display dynamic patterns of brilliant 
                 lights that appear as curtains, rays, spirals, or dynamic flickers covering the entire sky</p>
            <p>
                Auroras are the result of disturbances in the magnetosphere caused by solar wind. These disturbances alter the trajectories of charged particles in 
                the magnetospheric plasma. These particles, mainly electrons and protons, precipitate into the upper atmosphere (thermosphere/exosphere).
                 The resulting ionization and excitation of atmospheric constituents emit light of varying colour and complexity. The form of the aurora, 
                 occurring within bands around both polar regions, is also dependent on the amount of acceleration imparted to the precipitating particles.
                Most of the planets in the Solar System, some natural satellites, brown dwarfs, and even comets also host auroras. 
            </p>
            <h2>Causes</h2>
            <p>A quiescent solar wind flowing past Earth's magnetosphere steadily interacts with it and can both inject solar wind particles directly onto the 
                geomagnetic field lines that are 'open', as opposed to being 'closed' in the opposite hemisphere, and provide diffusion through the bow shock. 
                It can also cause particles already trapped in the radiation belts to precipitate into the atmosphere. Once particles are lost to the atmosphere 
                from the radiation belts, under quiet conditions, new ones replace them only slowly, and the loss-cone becomes depleted. In the magnetotail, however,
                 particle trajectories seem constantly to reshuffle, probably when the particles cross the very weak magnetic field near the equator. As a result, the 
                 flow of electrons in that region is nearly the same in all directions ("isotropic") and assures a steady supply of leaking electrons. The leakage of
                  electrons does not leave the tail positively charged, because each leaked electron lost to the atmosphere is replaced by a low energy electron drawn 
                  upward from the ionosphere. Such replacement of "hot" electrons by "cold" ones is in complete accord with the second law of thermodynamics. The
                   complete process, which also generates an electric ring current around Earth, is uncertain.</p>
            <p>
                The details of these phenomena are not fully understood. However, it is clear that the prime source of auroral particles is the solar wind feeding the 
                magnetosphere, the reservoir containing the radiation zones and temporarily magnetically-trapped particles confined by the geomagnetic field, coupled 
                with particle acceleration processes.

            <h2>There are many things we can be thankful for, one of them being is that the Wise Men had clear night skies on their way to Bethlehem.</h2>

            <p>Theories about the Christmas star fall into two main groups, depending on your point of view: a. It is only a nice story or b. It is true. Possibility b. then leads to the question, what was the Christmas star? Some say it was a miraculous sign, which would best fit the Biblical narrative that the star moved and hovered over the manger.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Others point to a possible supernova- a rare exploding star that can outshine every star in the sky; an unusual large comet; or a rare conjunction of bright planets- which was known to have occurred in the general time frame of Christ's birth.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Ask almost any child in Western Society about what the North Pole means to them and you will likely hear it is the abode of one Mr. Claus; the domicile of eight or nine reindeer, an assortment of elves and Saint Nick and his family; where Kris Kringle "hangs his hat."</p>
            <br>
            <p>What would the jolly fellow see from his ice cap home when he looked up? Right at the North Pole- where the barbershop pole is supposedly planted- the North Star, or Polaris, shines straight overhead. Around the very horizon is the Celestial Equator.</p>
            <br>
            <p>From mid-northern latitudes such as where Pennsylvania is found, the Big Dipper just misses the north horizon, as well as the W-shaped constellation Cassiopeia, on the opposite side from the North Star. We call these constellations "circumpolar" in that they never set.

                Others are the Little Dipper (Ursa Minor the Little Bear); Draco the Dragon; Cepheus the King and Camelopardalis, the Giraffe. From the North Pole, the entire visible sky is circumpolar!</p>

            <h2>The rare clouds formed unusually colourful formations in the skies over the UK.</h2>

            <p> Unusually colourful cloud formations across the UK have sparked false reports of the aurora borealis.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Many were surprised to see the bright lights in the sky on the evening of 1 February, with some mistaking them for the rare Northern Lights, which are typically not seen over Britain.</p>
            <br>
            <p>However, AuroraWatch UK, Lancaster University's aurora monitoring service, said the conditions were not right for the Northern Lights to appear over the country on Monday night.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Instead, they believe the unusual lights were down to high-altitude clouds known as nacreous clouds.

                The rare sightings occur when sunlight from below the horizon is reflected and refracted by these clouds, which usually form in the stratosphere, around 15,000 to 25,000 feet from the Earth's surface.
                
                </p>
            <br>
            <p>Clouds typically do not form at such high altitudes, but during the winter, when temperatures drop, enough moisture can be present for the unusual formations to develop.

                The phenomenon usually occurs at twilight or just before dawn, and can produce colourful, shimmering lights, which look very similar to the aurora borealis.</p>
